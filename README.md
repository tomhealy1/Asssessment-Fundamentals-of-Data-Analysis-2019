## Assignment outline
The purpose of this assignment is to conduct analysis of the well known tips dataset using packages such as seaborn and jupyter. The jupyter notebook contains the tasks outlines in the [assignment](https://github.com/tomhealy1/Asssessment-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2019/blob/master/Data_Analytics_Fund_Sem2_2019_Assignment.pdf). The instructions for running the notebook are below.

The assignment will be broken down into 4 main parts:

## 1. Description - 

An overview of the set using decriptive stats and plotting to convey the properties (types of data, min/max/avg etc .) and shape or distribution of values contained within the dataset. Theh plotting will concentrate on the main plot as outlined in the lectured but I will use some of the lesser known plots such as violin plots just to become familar with them. In addition to the overall description, I also investigate integrity of the data and on encountering an outlier, I assess the signicance and put forward threee strategies for dealing with it. 

## 2. Regression - 

Using regression we will explore and analyse the extent of the relationship between total bill and the tip amount. I 

## 3. Analyse - 

We will analyse the relationship between the variables cintained within the dataset. 

## 4. ML - 

I am going to try and put in a ML to predict the tip amount based on some features.

## Tools used

This assignment will use a number of different tools to carry out the tasks in the assignment. The tools we will use are:

Python - see instructions below on how to install:

* Pandas - Data Manipulation

* Numpy - numerical/computational operations

* Matplotlib - Data Visualisation

* Scipy (scipy.stats) - An additional numerical package (some extra distributions exist in Scipy)

* Seaborn - An additional data visualisation package

## Instructions

1. If you have not already done so, please download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) for Python 3.7.

2. Once you install Anaconda, the packages listed above should be installed also.

3. Go to https://github.com/tomhealy1/Asssessment-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2019 and download the repo

4. Navigate to the folder you saved the repo in using your CLI or terminal

5. Change Directory to the folder, for example:
-- C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop > ```cd C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop\assessment_fund```

6. You can now run the notebook using ```jupyter notebook``` command in the terminal

7. When opened, run all cells.
